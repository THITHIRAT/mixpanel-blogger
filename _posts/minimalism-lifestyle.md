__Minimalism__

After 80 million views on Netflix, The Minimalists' first documentary, Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things, is now on YouTube. Directed by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Matt D'Avella, Minimalism examines the simple lives of minimalists from all walks of life—families, entrepreneurs, architects, artists, journalists, scientists, and even a former Wall Street broker—all of whom are living meaningfully with less.


__Podcast__

In the Minimalism Life Podcast, one half of The Minimalists and New York Times–bestselling author Joshua Fields Millburn reads and comments on essays published in our Inside Minimalism book. Each episode is just a few minutes long. Minimal distraction and easy listening.
